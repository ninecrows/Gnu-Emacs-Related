Printing via Ghostscript
 Alec Clews reports success at using Ghostscript to perform his printing - using gsview version 3.4, and Ghostscript version 6.01 

 The configuration is straightforward, here's his settings, (which you should modify to suit). 

      (setq ps-lpr-command "C:\\Program Files\\Ghostgum\\gsview\\gsprint.exe")

      ;; THis line causes ghostscript to query which printer to
      ;; use - which you may not need if, for example, you only
      ;; have one printer.
      (setq ps-lpr-switches '("-query"))

      (setq ps-printer-name t)
 The commandline options are documented in the gsprint.htm file which comes with Ghostscript.
