# Gnu-Emacs-Related

A place to store my various emacs lisp code that tends to follow me
around. This is quite cluttered with old stuff and remnants of
previous places I've coded (host names, settings and such). One of
these days I'll get around to cleaning up a bit more...for now this
will at least help keep systems in sync.

Initial upload. This stuff has been copied around and mutated quite a
bit. Hoping to unify it some and keep systems in sync better now that
it is stored in a central location.

Just discovered the (relatively) new package manager for emacs (was
getting ready to download CSharp-mode to another computer and my
google search pointed me to a better way). I've rummaged around a
little bit but I'm sure there's much more in there than I've seen so
far...not quite sure how to get systems to auto-load packages but I
expect that can be arranged...

Looking at the list of packages that I've got stored in local lisp, it
is clear that I need to do some weeding sometime soon.
